 * \brief Smart Parameter Management.
 *
 * With large amounts of geometry the device can run out of Parameter Buffer
 * (PB) as no more free pages are left in the freelist to allow the PB to grow.
 * In such cases the render is split into multiple partial renders (PRs) to fit
 * within the memory constraints. Each PR produces intermediary results until
 * they have all completed, producing the final scene equivalent to what would
 * have been produced by the original render.
 *
 * SPM comprises all the necessary work required of the driver to manage the PB.
